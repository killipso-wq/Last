Consolidated Summary: DFS NFL Simulator + Blitz Framework
1. Current Setup (Your System)

Data: 2022–2024 cached (weekly.parquet, snap_counts, optional NGS).

Features already engineered:

player_usage.parquet, team_context.parquet, defense_adjust.parquet.

Defensive multipliers for YPT (pass defense), YPC (rush defense).

Vegas anchoring, env_modifiers (dome/weather).

Simulator (simulation_engine.py):

Runs 10k Monte Carlo sims per player.

Restricts to weekly players.csv (no extras).

Produces p10, p25, p50, p75, p90, Boom%, mean.

Supports “Miami-only” quick test.

Uses DK scoring.

Optimizer (GPP lineup lab):

Stage 1: simulate projections → generate 150 lineups.

Stage 2: analyze lineup portfolio, adjust based on leverage, ownership (RST%), stacking, game theory, then finalize 150.

UI: Streamlit prototype, CSV upload.

2. Blitz-Style Framework (Sections 3.2–4.3)

3.2 Data Acquisition:

Uses nflfastpy to download/play-by-play since 1999.

Includes EPA (expected points added).

3.3 Feature Engineering:

Filters to pass/rush plays.

Aggregates weekly offensive & defensive EPA per play.

Builds Exponentially Weighted Moving Averages (EWMA) as lag features → captures momentum/recency.

3.4 Logistic Regression Model:

Predicts binary outcome: home team win/loss.

Inputs: home_off_epa, home_def_epa, away_off_epa, away_def_epa.

Baseline accuracy ~63–66% (beats 57% “always pick home” baseline).

3.5 Model Evaluation:

Accuracy checked on holdout season (train 1999–2019, test 2020).

Coefficients: interpretable → confirm logical signs (offense positive, defense negative).

4.1 From Model to Actionable Insight:

Betting: convert win % → implied moneyline odds; compare to sportsbook.

DFS: value isn’t just projections → must account for ownership, stacking, leverage.

4.2 Optimizer Ecosystem:

Most people use commercial optimizers (build lineups fast).

Edge = custom projections → then feed into optimizer.

Hybrid = your current setup (custom projections + your optimizer).

4.3 Avenues for Improvement:

Add more features (turnovers, penalties, opponent-adjusted EPA, special teams).

Try advanced ML (XGBoost, LightGBM, NN).

Move to player-level projections (target share, carry share, efficiency).

Backtest continuously to refine knobs/settings.

3. Overlap Between Your Simulator & Blitz Approach

✅ Both build from team-level → player-level.
✅ Both use opponent-adjusted efficiency (EPA vs. your defense multipliers).
✅ Both emphasize lag/recency in features (EWMA vs. your rolling context).
✅ Both stress leverage/game theory for DFS (ownership, stacking).
✅ Both end with an optimizer layer.

⚠️ Differences:

Blitz baseline model is logistic regression (team win%) → more of a betting model.

Your simulator already projects player-level distributions (more DFS-ready).

Blitz uses long historical (since 1999), you’re only using 2022–2024.

Blitz explicitly validates with out-of-sample testing; you haven’t fully built a backtest harness yet.

4. Key Questions Raised Earlier (Consolidated)

Data window: Do you want to keep it 2022–2024 (stable, modern NFL) or extend back further (adds volume but risks outdated play styles)?

Validation strategy: Should we measure accuracy vs. real outcomes (weekly stats, win/loss) or benchmark vs. DFS Milly lineups?

Target metric: Are we optimizing for player projection accuracy (R², MAE), or DFS portfolio outcomes (ROI, expected finish percentile)?

Blending models: Should logistic regression (team-level) feed into your sim (player-level), or should you skip directly to XGBoost/LightGBM at the player level?

Backtesting: Do you want a week-by-week harness (simulate → compare to reality → track error), or a “DFS winner overlap” test (did our exposures align with real winning lineups)?

5. Recommendations & Path Forward
Step 1. Build a Backtest Harness

Run your simulator on 2022–2024.

Compare outputs to:

Actual player DK scores (projection accuracy).

Milly-winning lineups (portfolio DNA overlap).

Track error metrics (MAPE, correlation, exposure overlap).

Step 2. Decide on Validation Benchmark

If goal = better projections: validate vs. real player stats.

If goal = DFS lineup ROI: validate vs. contest results.

Likely best: do both (projection error + lineup overlap).

Step 3. Add Team-Level EPA Layer (Blitz-Style)

Incorporate rolling EPA features → adjust your team_context priors.

Anchors your sim to something interpretable and historically validated.

Step 4. Experiment with Advanced Models

Try XGBoost/LightGBM at the player stat level.

Use logistic regression as baseline (sanity check).

Keep interpretability → don’t black-box everything.

Step 5. Iterate Portfolio Strategy

Once sims are stable:

Tune leverage weight vs. raw projection.

Experiment with different stack rules (QB + WR1 vs QB + WR2/TE).

Anchor exposures to match winning lineup DNA.

6. Big Picture

You’re already ahead of Blitz because you’re at the player-level distribution stage.

Blitz-style logistic regression = great team anchor layer you can fold in.

Your edge will come from:

Custom sim-trained player distributions (nobody else has).

Game-theory optimizer rules tuned on Milly backtests.

Continuous validation loop to prove sharpness before Week 1.
