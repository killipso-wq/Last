# Football Monte Carlo Simulator (scaffold)

Minimal scaffold for single-user deployment:
- FastAPI backend in src/api
- Streamlit frontend in src/ui
- docker-compose.yml to run both containers
- artifacts/ folder used at runtime to store uploaded files and results

Replace or extend the src/ files with your simulator code later.
